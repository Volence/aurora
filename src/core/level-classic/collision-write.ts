// LINK vs ISOLATE, decided once, with every refusal in one place.
//
// Link is a one-entry colind write: the block's shape changes everywhere the
// block is used, ZONE-wide. Isolate clones the block, repoints THIS chunk cell
// at the clone, and gives the clone the new shape — same pixels, different
// collision, which is what SurfaceEditPlan.newBlocks' colind override exists
// for.
//
// The refusals carry as much weight as the writes, and two of them are about
// data the editor cannot see: a block id past the end of the colind table
// resolves into the NEXT ZONE's table in ROM, so both changing it (link) and
// creating one (isolate) would define entries whose real values are unknown.
//
// Pure core — no store, no fs. `classicSetColind` and `classicPaintSurface`
// (src/renderer/state/classicLevelStore.ts) are the actual writers; this
// module only decides WHAT to hand them, and refuses what neither of them
// should be asked to do.
