"""Shared read/refuse/write for games/sonic4/data/editor_bg_override.json.

TWO tools rewrite this file wholesale -- tools/png_to_bg_override.py (PNG ->
layout/tiles, optionally palette) and tools/forest_bg_gen.py (procedural forest
-> layout/tiles/anims) -- and BOTH used to build a fresh dict and `json.dump`
it without ever reading the file. Each therefore destroyed the other's keys.

That is not hypothetical. It fired on master: at b0e5a661 the file carried two
real BgAnim bands (32x4 camera_x @ slot 0, 16x4 timer @ slot 128, 8 phases
each -- 192 animated slots). At dd93a840, the commit that introduced
png_to_bg_override.py and ran it, the file has only layout/tiles. The bands
were gone, and OJZ background animation has been dead in the ROM since. The
JSON is minified, so in `git --stat` the loss rendered as a single changed
line.

WHY REFUSAL AND NOT MERGE -- this is the terminal answer for these tools, not a
placeholder pending a ruling:

  `anims`, `tiles` and `layout` are NOT separable keys. Bands pack contiguously
  from slot 0 (inject_editor_bg.py) and DMA over the FRONT of the static tile
  blob, so a band's phase-0 art IS those slots' rest state. Measured on the
  b0e5a661 data: phases[0] == tiles[slot_base:slot_base+cols*rows] for both
  bands, exactly.

  So a read-modify-write that retained `anims` while regenerating layout/tiles
  from new input would pass every assert in inject_editor_bg.py, bake cleanly,
  and ship a ROM where the retained bands DMA stale phase art over whatever the
  new dedup placed in slots 0..191. Silent visual corruption that clears every
  gate -- strictly worse than the deletion, which at least is recoverable from
  git.

Hence: a tool carries only keys IT owns, and stops on anything else. Callers
must offer an --out/BG_OUT escape so a refusal never tempts anyone to delete
the bands just to get past it.

    CANONICAL SERIALIZATION (contract §5, agreed with the Aurora lane 2026-08-22):
    sorted keys, no separator padding. This file has multiple writers across two
    repos — this chokepoint for aeon, Aurora's `serializeBgOverride` for the editor —
    and until now they disagreed on separators, so an alternation rewrote the whole
    file with no semantic change. Determined serialization is the point, not
    compactness: a diff must appear only when something semantic changed.

    Why that matters more here than it looks: this document is minified and single
    line, so `git --stat` reports "1 line changed" whatever happened inside it. That
    is how a two-band `anims` deletion went unnoticed for a month. Format churn on a
    one-line file is indistinguishable from content churn, so eliminating the format
    churn is what makes the content churn visible.
